# Windows98
A Windows 98 prototype built in Power Apps!

Just a fun mini project because why not :)

Please note that this Canvas App is using a custom font that is not installed on your computer by default. You will need to install it (I've uploaded it to this repo) - I used Windows Font as the classic Windows98 font (MS Sans Serif) didn't load up properly in the studio. Windows Font is the closest to that font I could find.
